Description: CLUSTER on existing table

PGM018 — CLUSTER on existing table

What it detects:
A CLUSTER statement targeting a table that already exists in the
database (i.e., the table was not created in the same set of changed
files).

Why it matters:
CLUSTER rewrites the entire table and all its indexes in a new
physical order, holding an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock for the full
duration of the rewrite. Unlike VACUUM FULL, there is no online
alternative. On large tables this causes complete unavailability
(all reads and writes blocked) for the duration — typically minutes
to hours. It is almost never appropriate in an online migration.

Example:
CLUSTER orders USING idx_orders_created_at;

Recommended approach:
1. Schedule CLUSTER during a maintenance window when downtime is acceptable.
2. Consider pg_repack or pg_squeeze for online table rewrites.
3. For new tables, CLUSTER is fine — this rule only fires on existing tables.

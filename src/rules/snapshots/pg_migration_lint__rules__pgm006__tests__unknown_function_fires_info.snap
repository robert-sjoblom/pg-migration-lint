  message: "Column 'computed' on 'orders' uses function 'my_custom_func()' as default. If this function is volatile (the default for user-defined functions), it forces a full table rewrite under an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock instead of a cheap catalog-only change. Verify the function's volatility classification."

Rule: PGM103
Severity: MINOR
Description: Column uses char(n) type

PGM103 — Don't use `char(n)`

What it detects:
A column declared as `char(n)` or `character(n)`.

Why it's problematic:
In PostgreSQL, `char(n)` pads values with trailing spaces to fill
the declared length. This wastes storage, causes surprising equality
semantics (trailing spaces are ignored in comparisons but present
in the stored data), and is no faster than `text` or `varchar`.

The PostgreSQL documentation itself recommends using `text` or
`varchar` instead: "There is no performance difference among these
three types" and "In most situations text or character varying
should be used instead."

Example (bad):
CREATE TABLE countries (code char(2) NOT NULL);

Fix:
CREATE TABLE countries (code text NOT NULL);
-- or: code varchar(2) NOT NULL

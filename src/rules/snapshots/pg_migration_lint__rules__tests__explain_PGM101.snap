Description: Column uses timestamp without time zone

PGM101 — Don't use `timestamp` (without time zone)

What it detects:
A column declared as `timestamp` (which PostgreSQL interprets as
`timestamp without time zone`).

Why it's problematic:
`timestamp` (without time zone) stores a date/time value with no
timezone context. This makes the stored values ambiguous — they could
represent any timezone, and PostgreSQL performs no conversion on
input or output. When servers, clients, or applications use different
timezones, this leads to subtle, hard-to-debug data corruption.

`timestamptz` (timestamp with time zone) stores values as UTC
internally and converts to the session's timezone on output. This
ensures unambiguous points in time.

Example (bad):
CREATE TABLE events (created_at timestamp NOT NULL);

Fix:
CREATE TABLE events (created_at timestamptz NOT NULL);

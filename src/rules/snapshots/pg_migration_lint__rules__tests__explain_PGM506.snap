Severity: INFO
Description: CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE

PGM506 — CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE

What it detects:
A CREATE TABLE statement that uses the UNLOGGED keyword.

Why it matters:
Unlogged tables offer better write performance because they skip
the write-ahead log, but come with significant trade-offs:
- Data is TRUNCATED after a crash or unclean shutdown.
- The table is NOT replicated to standby servers.
- They cannot participate in logical replication.
These characteristics make unlogged tables unsuitable for any
data that must survive a crash or be available on replicas.

Example (flagged):
CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE scratch_data (id int, payload text);

When unlogged tables are appropriate:
- Ephemeral staging/import data that can be re-derived.
- Materialised caches where the source of truth lives elsewhere.
- ETL scratch space within a batch job.

This rule is INFO severity — it flags the table for review rather
than treating it as a defect.

  severity: Minor
  message: "Column 'token' on 'orders' uses volatile default 'gen_random_uuid()'. Unlike non-volatile defaults, this forces a full table rewrite under an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock — every existing row must be physically updated with a computed value. For large tables, this causes extended downtime. Consider adding the column without a default, then backfilling with batched UPDATEs."
